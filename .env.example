# Environment Variables

This project requires the following environment variable to enable AI features:

## Required

- `API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key for the AI strategist feature

## Setting Up Environment Variables

### For Local Development (Vite)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Note:** In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client.

### For v0 / Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add the following variable:
   - **Name:** `VITE_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your Gemini API key
4. Select which environments it should be available in (Production, Preview, Development)

### Important Notes

- The API key is currently accessed via `process.env.API_KEY` in the code, but Vite requires `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`
- **Never commit your `.env` file to version control** - it's already in `.gitignore`
- The AI strategist feature will gracefully fail with a warning message if the API key is missing
